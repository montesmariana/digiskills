    "text": "The idea is to carve out a space in our schedules for investing in our digital skills, from managing and processing our data, to exploring it with tables and plots, to reporting it in a reliable and reproducible way. These are tasks that often take a lot of time and bring deep frustration, because we are either not trained at it or the only training we received is abstract and applied to fictitious and/or unrelatable examples. However, well acquired skills can save us a lot of time and effort, so that we can better focus our energies on content and analysis. This is what this space is for.\nIt is organized within the Linguistics Department of the Faculty of Arts, KU Leuven. It takes place every Friday from 11:00 to 13:00.\nFor any questions, please contact Mariana Montes."

    "text": "Quarto\nSince most of the people in the second session were not present during the first session, we discussed Quarto again. We talked about how, if you know R Markdown, it will be easy to try out; if you don’t, it might be best go to Quarto directly. Many features that require combinations of {rmarkdown} and other packages are fully covered by Quarto.\nWe also saw an example of a Quarto presentation written in VS Code and using no computations! It did have a mermaid graph :)"

    "text": "R projects\nHave you ever used R Projects?\nMost of us learn to use R by clicking on an R file (often a script someone else gave us) and letting RStudio open it, or by opening R Studio and just typing it. The working directory will then be the folder where that R file lives. If we want to work on different things at the same time, we’ll have those scripts open simultaneously and they will mingle: the console will be the same, the environment (loaded libraries and variables, functions…) will be the same… that can be very confusing and will certainly mess with the reproducibility of your code.\nAn R Project is a feature of RStudio that helps you keep your code organized in projects. You can open them separately in multiple sessions and manage them with ease, keeping unrelated code and data apart. Moreover, you can get help from packages such as {here}, {targets} and {renv} (see for example my blogpost on this).\nTry working with R Projects, your R experience will be totally different (for the best)!"

Many features that require combinations of {rmarkdown} and other packages are fully covered by Quarto. Moreover, it does not depend on R; you can also use it with Python, Julia or no code at all!\nInstalling Quarto is quite straightforward; then R Studio identifies it and offers you the option of creating Quarto documents, with a simple template you can render immediately."

    "text": "Integrating Quarto/RMarkdown with Zotero\nThe markup language in Quarto and RMarkdown (markdown) makes it very easy to cite sources, and the compilation takes care of generating the reference list at the end of your document. However, it might be difficult to remember the citation keys of each source you want to cite. For that purpose, the {rbbt} package offers you a connection between R and Better Bibtex for Zotero, letting you choose your sources from a pop-up window and automatically updating your .bib file."
